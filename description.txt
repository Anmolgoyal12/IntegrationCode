Before Startig for Postgresql in powershell 
    1. We have the connection details 
    2. In Connection Details we should Know the Hostname,
         port,password,dbname,username
    3. After getting step 2 details Now we have two options
        3.1 To hide password details 
        3.2 To show the password details in script.
    4. If we have to select option 3.1 then we have to encrypt the password by using Read-Host.
        4.1 Read-Host is kind of powershell cmdlet for Prompting the input to user.
        4.2 When it is combined with -AsSecureString Parameters then it helps to encript
        the Confidencial informatiom like password etc,
        4.3 Example :
            $username=Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a Username"
            This will display in console "Enter a Username" and store in $username variable.
        4.4 After Encrypting gthe string now we have to decrypt
        4.5 for Example :
            $BSTR=[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($password)
            Above line describes that encryptes secure string which is stored in $password in a unencrypted  form which is represneted in binary string or bstr .
            As the BSTR is a kind of data type used in windows for string in memory.
            If we want to perform  decryption to plain text then we have to use bstr or binary string in windows.
            it implies the decrypted secure string converts into redable format in memory but it can read by normal humans.

            SecureStringToBSTR is part os System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.
            SecureStringToBSTR takes the encrypted string and decrypted into bstr as it is block of memory that decrypts the password  into unicode format.

            $plainPassword = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto($BSTR)
            Above line converts the decrypted bstr into plain text which can be redaible.

            PtrToStringAuto method is also part of System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal class,  which takes a pointer to memory block and onverts it into regular string in powershell.
            as this line implies the decrypted memory data is converted into readable plain text.
        4.6 Next steps is to define the table structure as we have to create table.
                @tableCreationQuery is script which is used to create a the table in psql dataase . as it help in creting the table in postgresql.
            
            Now we have to crete table and check if not exist . it implies that check if table not exist then it create the table if exist not create the table.
            now give column name with data type as text becuase the data can be large .

        4.7 $env:PGPASSWORD=$plainPassword. it helps to set the Environment variable for password

            $env:PGPASSWORD: it refers to Environment variable on powershell
            PGPASSWORD: is the name of envrionment variable that helps in connecting with postgresql command line to pass the database password.

            $plainPassword:this implies that password which is decrypted when user enter the password in console. 
        4.8 $psqlCommand = @" 
            psql -h $hostname -d $dbname -p $port -U $username -c "$tableCreationQuery"
            "@  it help to define multi line string that holds postgresql command used for creating the  table in postgresql database
            @" ... "@:: is used to store the multi line string literal
            psql: it is postgresql command that allow you to execute queries.
            -h $hostname:: hostname(-h is the hostname of the postgresql server)
            -d $dbname:: database name (-d database name which is used to connect)
            -p $port: is the port Number to connect to database
            -u $username: is the username who connect to postgresql database.
            -c "$tableCreationQuery": this command will run as part of psql Execution.
        4.9 Invoke-Expression $psqlCommand: it evaluates or executes string stored in the $psqlCommand variable as if it were a command typed directly into the PowerShell terminal.
        $psqlCommand is powershell variable that holds multilinevariable
        5. Now next step is to store we have to take excel file path as if we have done from local then local path will be given.
            5.1 now we have to read data from excel before that we have to install ImportExcel module
            5.2 now we have to insert the data into table .
            5.3 $sqlScript = $sqlStatements -join "`n" isused to combine multiple insert statement into one script using array
            5.4 Now we have to give sql file path where out sql file will give Required output
            5.5 Set-Content: it is cmdlet in powershell used to write data in file. it can either create a new file or replace the existing file with new content.
            5.6 -Path :specifies the path should be written and $sqlFilePath: it implies exact path of sql file.
            5.7 -Value: specifies the content that will be written in file.
            5.8 $sqlScript: as it contains sql script by joining mulitple insert statements.
            if the file is already exist then it overwrite the content of the file.
        6. $psqlCommand = "psql -h $hostname -p $port -d $dbname -U $username -f `"$sqlFilePath`"":
            $sqlFilePath: implies the sql file path in which data is written.the path should be correct.
        7. Invoke-Expression $psqlCommand: it is used to execute the  string which is stored in $psqlCommand variable  into powershell.   
                7.1.  Invoke-Expression: it is cmdlet in powershell that runs as a command or expression when any string is passed to it.
                7.2. $psqlCommand: the variable actual psql command to be executed.
                7.3  Remove-Item Env:PGPASSWORD  : is used to delete the envrionment variable from powershell session 
                7.4 Remove-Item:it is powershell cmdlet used to delete or remove files,registery keys or vaiables that is stored as Environment variable.
                7.5 ENV: it is a powershell provider that provide the access to use Environment variable.
                7.6 PGPASSWORD  : it is Environment variable which we used earlier to store the postgresql password into plin text.
